#dndBattleMaster

## Desired Features to Impliment
1. User Sign In
  - Save fights (the existing CombatantList)
  - using express on the BackEnd
2. Layouts
  - Possibly using Router to have different layouts of the page i.e having a combatant focused layout that shows all of the combatants detailed stats on the page, and the current layout which is better for selecting Combatants one at a time.
3. Stylings
  - general stylings
  - better layout for MonsterDetail.js
  - Roll.js divs
  - MonsterList.js
  - CombatantList.js
