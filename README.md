# Monster Encounter
Monster Encounter is a combat tool for 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons. This tool allows Dungeon Masters to streamline and manage their combats with features such as auto rolling, hit point tracking, and initiative tracking. DMs, as they are colloquially known, can use this tool in place of the typical pen and paper to make their combats more fun and engaging.
